## Business Problem
The company experienced strong sales growth but inconsistent profitability. Management wanted to understand why revenue growth was not translating into profit growth and identify areas where profit leakage was occurring.

## Objective

## Dataset
The analysis was performed using an e-commerce sales dataset containing order-level information such as order date, product category and sub-category, sales, profit, discount, region, and customer segment.

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Power Query, data modeling, and visualizations)
- SQL (analytical queries)
- Excel (initial data inspection)

## Key Analysis Steps
- Checked the data for quality issues and cleaned it using Power Query.
- Compared sales and profit trends over time to understand where margins were breaking down.
- Drilled into product categories and sub-categories to identify loss-making areas.
- Analyzed how discount levels affected profit to uncover the main cause of losses.

## Key Insights
- Sales showed steady growth over time, but profit did not grow at the same pace, indicating margin leakage.
- Furniture emerged as the weakest category in terms of profitability despite strong sales contribution.
- Within Furniture, Tables consistently generated losses while contributing significant revenue.
- Higher discounts on Tables were closely associated with negative profit, making discounting the primary driver of losses.

## Business Recommendations
- Reduce aggressive discounting on loss-making Table products, especially where discounts consistently result in negative profit.
- Re-evaluate pricing and cost structure for Furniture, with a focus on Tables.
- Limit promotional campaigns on unprofitable products and redirect efforts toward higher-margin items.
- Introduce minimum margin thresholds to prevent discount-driven losses in the future.

## Deliverables
- Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing sales, profit, and discount impact.
- Documented analysis with key insights and business recommendations.
